# discord-posting-bot

A Python client Discord bot that listens to the Golang Server to post Twitter posts of choice onto the specified Discord server.
Environment variables inside the code should be self explainitory, if you have issues, DM me.
I might expand the backend API to which the client communicates to.

Feel free to do with this project as you wish.
